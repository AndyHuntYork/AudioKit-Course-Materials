# AudioFilePlayback

The Hello World app demonstrates how to play an audio file.

The documentation for `AKAudioPlayer` can be found [here](http://audiokit.io/docs/Classes/AKAudioPlayer.html)];

To explore how you can add a delay effect to an audio file, take a look at some of the Playground
code [here](http://audiokit.io/playgrounds/Variable%20Delay%20Operation/).
