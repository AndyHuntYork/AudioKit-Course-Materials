        /* Load a file into the sampler. Here, we demonstrate that in addition
            to using .WAV files, you can also use EXS24 files. EXS24 files
            are sample files used in Logic Pro's EXS24 sampler. In the left side
            panel, you'll see that we also have a "basicSamples" folder, which 
            are small audio files used by the EXS file. Check out some
            of the sample files you can use here: 
         http://www.logic-cafe.com/lc/index.php/free-downloads/exs24-instruments
            
            You can also load in a Sound Font file by using 
            `sampler.loadSoundFont`. If you're not familiar with Sound Fonts, 
            the Wikipedia page gives a good overview: 
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont */
