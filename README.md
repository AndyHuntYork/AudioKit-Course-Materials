# AudioKit-Course-Materials
Course Materials for Dr. Hunt's iOS - audio programming course

These examples are based off of code from [AudioKit's Playgrounds](audiokit.io/playgrounds/).

All examples use the [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

For instructions on how to Download and install the AudioKit framework into your project, take a 
look at Aure's screencast on the [AudioKit Downloads page](http://audiokit.io/downloads/).

Included Examples:

1) HelloWorld-AudioKit --- an app that plays a simple sine wave on app-launch

2) OscillatorUI --- extending the previous example, we show how to use Apple UIElements to 
control our oscillator

3) AudioFilePlayback --- an app that will play a looped audio file on app launch

4) AudioFileReverb --- extending the previous example, we will apply reverb to our audio sample. 
We'll also demonstrate how to chain audio effects together. 

5) ReverbUI --- an app that demonstrates a more complicated UI controlled set-up, as well as 
providing an introduction to some basic Object-Oriented programming concepts. 

6) Mixer --- an app that demonstrates how to mix audio files together using `AKMixer`
